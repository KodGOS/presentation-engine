This is a guide how to make your own presentation with this program.

First of all we need the settings.txt file.

The first line is how wide the resolution of the presentation is. (by default it is 1024, but you can change it)

The second line is how high the resolution of the presentation is. (by default it is 768, but you can change it)

The third line is how many slides are in the presentation. (by default it is 5, but you can change it)

And that's it.

You just put a bunch of pictures into the folder named "slides", and name the first slide "1.png", second slide "2.png" and so on.
